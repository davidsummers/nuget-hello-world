Demonstrate how to use NUGET in CMAKE to pull a library package and compile and link to it.

This process works on both Linux and Windows.

To generate the NUGET package:

cd producer/jsoncpp
cmake -B build
cmake --build build --target package

Then copy the generated build/jsoncpp.1.9.4.nupkg to your NUGET Source
repository.

To consume the NUGET package:

First make sure you have your nuget source repository set up.

cd consumer
cmake -B build
cmake --build build

Test by running the generated program:

./build/hello
